Schools schould consider introducing changes necesssary to steer youth toward anti-narrative orchestration in the coming technology age of AI and quick-to-deploy methodologies and countermeasures.

Courtrooms should consider incorporating mandatory ai awssisted clerks that interrupt if rules are broken. Hierarchy agnostic. Would also play a key role in getting government houses of debate back from the mockery off collap[se it currently faces.

airline tax + fees + design system calculate the real actual cost of flight, weight load, fue, distance age/aircraft, etc

Redesign existing educational textbook standard and sinstead offer adaptivcv/ modular content badsed on users' choices.

How could we overlook the fact that we are one big family when even our existing educational science testbooks frame it as such: think family, genus, species, etc.

Manual finger movement device, good for near instant deployment of solutions to actions requiring simple human input (think swiping, pushing, pressing, etc) would circumvent traditional labor costs of things such as:
- remote car starters

Need a classification system (or multiples) for existing dashboards, splash screens, backdrops etc. maybe even cross-pollinate from successful gamification deployments.

How can we further innovate the storytelling process via gamifcation or decentralization.

What other questions could i ask that may trigger breakthroughs in existing online story-telling methodologies in the digital ag?

As technoloy team leadtasked with improving the lives of humans inhabiting this world, what would be the best questions to ask from the following perspectives:

meta-systems architect
domain agnostic phd expert

etc

cross pollinatte successful findings that lead to benevolent outcomes for htybridized solutions to esxisting governmental and instituitonal crises.

What quewstions or conversations might I consider asking to empower the next generation of explorers with the leadership tools, util;ities, emotional artchitecture and daopt the equally important values to steer humaniotyy safely, humanely and with equal treatment unilaterally as we continue our journey through the stars?




What questions might a met-systems architect be asking or should ask here?

What narratives or subreddits and other online communiteies cani find and support to trigger the gradual shift in governance needed so that insitutions (vice-versa included) follow suit? The goal would be a government4 that actually SERVES the people, not one that gatekeeps the very basics neeeded to support thir very own surivvaval. Keep in mind the uses of tax ddollars at biotech labs etc. No more locked doors inititative. If kindness propagates, home invasions become welcomed overnight visits with gifts.
