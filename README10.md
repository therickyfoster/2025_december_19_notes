I once ssaw a compelling video of what appeared to be mountains.

Not long after I saw another video that showed the previous one was only a segment with poor quality. The long-form video I had once seen online (likely redacted along with the missile chasing ufo off the back of a carrier video) back in the day, during my near obsession with such ideas haha

Regardless, the video was that of a south american doctor who had somehow managed to get a live alien lifeform into his basement. The footage was very old, extremely hard to fake, 10/10 in terms of it being real in my honest opinion. Anyway, the doctor was struggling to keep the thing warm. He had it wrapped in a thermal blanket and the heat on high. 

This likely indicates that our world is hostile to other lifeforms due to low temp regulation requirements.

Global warming may be their attempt at retaliation for our hostile actions toward them earlier. The whole rogue AI steering us toward collapse may be a preseeding attempt to get our temperatures low enough to make takeover possible.
